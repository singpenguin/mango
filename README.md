mango
=====

mango is a powerful and simple golang web framework.

It borrowed from Python [web.py](https://github.com/webpy/webpy) and [tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado) framework design.

It implements nested templates, but does not support multiple levels of nesting.

The "StaticPath" parameter is recommended to use in the development of state.
